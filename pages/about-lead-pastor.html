                    <h2>ABOUT OUR LEAD PASTOR</h2>
                    <p>Pastor Jude I. Uzor, the General Overseer of the Dominion International Christian Ministries Worldwide, is a gift to the body of Christ and entire Christendom.</p>
                    <P>He is a man with the Word; who loves the Word; who declares the Word and who rightly believes in the living Word of God. No wonder the Motto of the ministry goes along his passion for the Word of God as it states, “Living by the Word!”.</p>
                </div>

        <div class="row mb-5">
            <!-- Text -->
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>With God’s grace upon this servant of God; you may not necessarily need to listen to him twice before you realize his knowledge and understanding of the Word of God. Without mincing words, God has endowed him with grace for the Word.</p>
                <p>Pastor Jude Uzor is a man with indisputable anointing for the liberation of children of men. Even though his quietness cannot be hidden when you have contact with him, however, he has fire on his inside for revival and to burn to ashes the works of darkness.</p>
                <p>Pastor Jude Uzor is a man of vision coupled with apostolic mandate endowed upon him from above. His vision has tremendously affected his surroundings, those around him and the entire ministry as a whole. His vision is often empowered by the level of his faith.</p>
                <p>Pastor Jude Uzor is man of faith. He believes everything is possible as long as it is according to the will of God. And this fact is seen in his passionate move to secure a permanent place of worship for the Headquarters’ church in Athens. In fact, when he made the move for the ministry to purchase its own property for the Headquarters’ church, it appeared the vision could not be actualized most especially for the economy crisis in the land (Greece) where the ministry started from. However, God who would not disappoint those who trust in Him supported his idea and the vision came to pass. Today, by faith, the ministry’s Headquarters’ church has secured a property where believers gather to worship the Lord and for fellowship with one another in the presence of God.</p>
