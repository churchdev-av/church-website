                <p>DICM is one of the fastest growing churches in Greece. Miracles, signs and wonders, salvation are taking place in our churches. God has proved His faithfulness and mercy in DICM. Worshipers are growing strong in the Lord, developing their ministries and impacting society, doing exploits for God, devouring and de-populating the kingdom of darkness, and harvesting souls for our Master Jesus Christ, the King of kings and the Ancient of Days.</p>
                <p>I must tell you one fact, "You have made the right choice to start browsing this website!" The only encouragement I have for all of you out there is this, "Just open up your heart to receive the blessings this website will be connecting you with!"</p>
                <p>The Bible says, "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the fruit of the land" (Isa. 1:19). My earnest prayer for you is that, "You will eat the good fruit from the throne of grace which this website will soon be divulging, in Jesus' name."</p>
